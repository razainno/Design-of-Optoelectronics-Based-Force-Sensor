# force-sensor
The following step for the design of the sensor has been completed.
Markup : 1. Mechanical design AND electrical design  of the sensor has been created
            1. A nested numbered list
            2. Which is numbered

         2. Read the raw data of from four sensors

         3. save the data for different weight (0kg ,0.5kg, 1.25kg, 1.75kg)
         4. Calculation of the weights for using least square method 
         5. calculation of the force using above calculated weights
         6. test the sensor for applying different force
